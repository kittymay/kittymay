      - I witnessed the remarkable skills Kitty has in working with women and with young people while she volunteered for our organisation in Cape Town. She was able to build relationships easily regardless of cultural barriers, and always acted professionally, remaining sensitive to contextual issues.
      - Kitty ran Sexual and Reproductive Health training for the facilitators of both our health and our youth programmes. Kitty prepared these sessions meticulously, and created materials that we are able to use long after she has left. She designed an appropriate intervention, aimed at where the participants were at in their development, and in line with the content that they needed to understand. She was flexible, adjusting to the group dynamics, and held the learning space delicately, ensuring all were included and valued.
      - The staff commented on how congruent Kitty was – that she spoke of sensitive issues with such ease and confidence that it made them, too, feel comfortable to open up, ask questions and share from their own experiences.

      - Kitty was my teaching assistant at McGill University. She is not only organized, prepared and responsible, but also one of the most natural and engaging instructors with whom I have ever worked.
      - When I sat in on one of her weekly conferences, I found her students quite eager to contribute to the conversation, which spoke to the excellent classroom environment Kitty had engineered. She did a great job of intervening at the right times without taking over, which in turn let her students have “ownership” over the discussion.
      - In concert with the Sexual Assault Centre of McGill Students' Society, Kitty developed a valuable training session on sexual harassment issues for our teaching assistants. The intelligence and insight with which Kitty designed this training further proved her mature and thoughtful understanding of pedagogical issues of all kinds.
      - She is, quite simply, a remarkable teacher.

    comments:
      - While employed by MAP, Kitty worked as an advice worker to young people aged 11-25 and trainer to professionals in partner agencies.
      - Kitty engages effectively with young people in both group settings and one-to-one with those in crisis and distress. Her group work is always engaging, active and fun, encouraging young people to engage with poignant issues that affect their lives. Kitty helps young people question their own assumptions and realise the impact they have on others. She relates to young people thoughtfully and creatively, with interest and warmth, and in a non-patronising way.
      - Her training to professionals is always well planned and researched, combining theory and practice. Her experiential approach means that participants reflect in a way that has a real impact on their practice.
