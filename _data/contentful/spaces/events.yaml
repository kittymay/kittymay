  title: 'Self-Compassion: What, Why & How'
  description: |-
    "Compassion is the master emotion of positive change" - Jack Morin

    In this class, I'll draw on my experience both as a therapist and a meditation practitioner as we explore what self-compassion is, why it benefits both ourselves and others, and how to cultivate it.

    We'll look at the ways in which practicing meditation can help to build self-compassion and how, in turn, self-compassion supports a meditation practice.

    I'll introduce some tools for practice, and there will be space for participants who feel comfortable to exhange experiences and share their self-compassion strategies.

    No meditation experience necessary!
