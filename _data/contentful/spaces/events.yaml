  title: Self-Compassion and Body-Image
  description: |-
    "There's no wrong way to have a body" - Glenn Marla

    How do you feel when you look in the mirror, see a photograph of yourself, or look down at your naked body in the shower?

    In this workshop, I’ll draw on my experience both as a therapist and a meditation practitioner as we explore how our thoughts and feelings about our bodies and appearance can impact – and reflect – our overall wellbeing.

    We’ll look at how meditation practices can help us to cultivate a loving, appreciative attitude towards our bodies, as well as learning about and trying out some different tools for infusing our body-image with self-compassion.

    There will be space for participants who feel comfortable doing so to share experiences and exchange ideas for developing self-compassion and a positive body-image.

    No previous meditation experience required!

    This workshop will build on some concepts and strategies introduced in Self-Compassion: What, Why & How, which takes place again on August 9th (link below), but you are warmly invited to join regardless of whether or not you participated in the earlier workshop.
  date_time: Wednesday, August 16th, 19 - 21:30

  cost: 20€ (sliding scale options available from 10-19€, based on ability to pay)

    "Compassion is the master emotion of positive change" - Jack Morin

    In this class, I'll draw on my experience both as a therapist and a meditation practitioner as we explore what self-compassion is, why it benefits both ourselves and others, and how to cultivate it.

    We'll look at the ways in which practicing meditation can help to build self-compassion and how, in turn, self-compassion supports a meditation practice.

    I'll introduce some tools for practice, and there will be space for participants who feel comfortable to exhange experiences and share their self-compassion strategies.

    No meditation experience necessary!
