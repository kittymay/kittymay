description_sections:
  - "'Compassion is the master emotion of positive change' - Jack Morin"
  - In this class, I'll draw on my experience both as a therapist and a meditation practitioner as we explore what self-compassion is, why it benefits both ourselves and others, and how to cultivate it.
  - We'll look at the ways in which practicing meditation can help to build self-compassion and how, in turn, self-compassion supports a meditation practice.
  - I'll introduce some tools for practice, and there will be space for participants who feel comfortable to exchange experiences and share their self-compassion strategies.
  - No meditation experience necessary!
