  - "'There's no wrong way to have a body' - Glenn Marla"
  - How do you feel when you look in the mirror, see a photograph of yourself, or look down at your naked body in the shower?
  - In this workshop, I’ll draw on my experience both as a therapist and a meditation practitioner as we explore how our thoughts and feelings about our bodies and appearance can impact – and reflect – our overall wellbeing.
  - We’ll look at how meditation practices can help us to cultivate a loving, appreciative attitude towards our bodies, as well as learning about and trying out some different tools for infusing our body-image with self-compassion.
  - There will be space for participants who feel comfortable doing so to share experiences and exchange ideas for developing self-compassion and a positive body-image.
  - No previous meditation experience required!
  - This workshop will build on some concepts and strategies introduced in Self-Compassion - What, Why & How, which takes place again on August 9th (link below), but you are warmly invited to join regardless of whether or not you participated in the earlier workshop.
