    <p>I am an <span class="emphasis dark-pink">educator and facilitator</span> for youth and adults, specialising in work on <span class="emphasis purple">sex, sexuality and relationships</span>. I believe that everyone has the right to <span class="emphasis light-pink">safe, healthy and pleasurable</span> sexual experiences â€“ as well as the right to determine for themselves what those terms mean.</p>
  	<p>My <span class="emphasis purple">person-centred and participatory</span> approach <span class="emphasis dark-pink">empowers people</span> with the knowledge and confidence to make informed, responsible choices; <span class="emphasis light-pink">encourages critical thinking</span>; and creates <span class="emphasis dark-pink">open, comfortable spaces</span> where people can reflect, share and learn.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I've been facilitating learning about sex, sexuality and relationships since 2004, initially as a volunteer in sexuality and gender awareness programmes and, from 2008, as a professional youth worker. With training and experience, I established expertise in sex and relationships education, and began training professionals on how (and why) to talk with youth about sex.</p>
    <p>I realised that it's not just young people who want information, or value the opportunity to explore ideas and feelings, about sexuality. So, I developed my practice further and started creating workshops and sessions for adults. Now based in Berlin, I have been a freelance sex educator, facilitator and trainer, for people of all ages, since 2012.</p>
    <p>As well as a BA (hons) (University of Leeds, UK) and an MA (McGill University, Canada) in English Literature, I hold a Diploma in Informal Education (YMCA George Williams College, UK) and a Postgraduate Certificate in Person-Centred Counselling Skills (University of East Anglia, UK). I have professional experience in both the non-profit and public sector, and have worked in Canada, the UK, South Africa and Germany. Please get in touch if you would like to see my full C.V.</p>
