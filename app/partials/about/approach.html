			  	  <p>I am an <span class="emphasis dark-pink">educator and facilitator</span> for youth and adults, specialising in work on <span class="emphasis purple">sex, sexuality and relationships</span>. I believe that everyone has the right to <span class="emphasis light-pink">safe, healthy and pleasurable</span> sexual experiences â€“ as well as the right to determine for themselves what those terms mean.

				  	<p>My <span class="emphasis purple">person-centred and participatory</span> approach <span class="emphasis dark-pink">empowers people</span> with the knowledge and confidence to make informed, responsible choices; <span class="emphasis light-pink">encourages critical thinking</span>; and creates <span class="emphasis dark-pink">open, comfortable spaces</span> where people can reflect, share and learn.</p>
