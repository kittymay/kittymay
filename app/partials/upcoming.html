      		<h4>Exploring Your Sexual Self: Past, Present & Future</h4>
			<p>with <a href="http://www.englishyogaberlin.com/about-english-yoga-berlin/bios/" target="_blank">Meg Saxby</a></p>

			<p>The erotic life, encompassing desire, pleasure, fantasy and experience, is a creative and meaningful current in many people's lives: a source of depth, connection and vitality. Yet we can also feel disconnected from, puzzled by, or ashamed of our sexual selves and don't often have the opportunity to consider, express and shape our own erotic journeys.</p>

			<p>This engaging workshop series will give participants tools and space to explore their sexual selves, and define their own vision of erotic empowerment. Over the course of 3 sessions, we will connect with our sexual selves as they are today; remember who they were in the past; imagine our brightest erotic futures - and consider the most luscious, fun and self-loving ways of getting there!</p>

			<p>Using movement, relaxation, discussion and creative tools for reflection, we will explore ideas about and experiences of desire, pleasure, fulfilment, the body and more. Each participant will choose an area of focus, creating a personal path within a collaborative learning process. There will be opportunities to share with one another, but no obligation to disclose more than is comfortable.</p>

			<p>Because we believe in celebration and the power of Gemütlichkeit, each session will begin with tea and snacks and will be followed by an optional yoga session (not included in the workshop fee).</p>

			<p>The series is open to FLTI* (female, lesbian, trans*, intersex) people only.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>When: Sundays January 25th, February 1st and February 8th, 11:00-15:00</li>
				<li>Where: at the English Yoga Berlin studio, Gorlitzer Straße 39, 10997 Berlin</li>
				<li>Cost: Because we want this series to be both accessible for participants and sustainable for us as workers, the price is based on participants' take-home monthly income and an hourly rate for our work. The fee for the series is:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>60€ if your monthly income is less than 700€</li>
					<li>100€ if your monthly income is 700-1000€</li>
					<li>150€ if your monthly income is 1000-1500€</li>
					<li>10-15% of your monthly income if you earn over 1500€</li>
				</ul>

				<li>Participate: to register, or if you have any questions, please email <a href="mailto:contactkittymay@gmail.com" target="_blank">contactkittymay@gmail.com</a>. A deposit of 1/3rd of your fee will be payable by bank transfer to secure your place.</li>
			</ul>

				<p>Please note:</p>

				<p>The series is open to FLTI* (female, lesbian, trans*, intersex) people only.</p>

				<p>While we both have some training in counseling and group praxis, neither of us are qualified therapists and this course is not intended as a substitute for therapeutic intervention. We ask participants to please make a considered decision about their readiness to participate and to place their well-being at the centre of that choice.</p>

				<p>We are committed to creating a space that is as safe and supportive as possible, and invite all participants to share responsibility for this environment. We believe in the capacity of intentional community to create safety, healing, learning and fun.</p>
