      		<h4>Self-Love: Act of Resistence, Tool for Resilience</h4>

			<p>“Loving ourselves in a racist/sexist/homo/transphobic/ablist/classist system is an every day act of war against that system” (Femme Shark Manifesto)</p>

			<p>This workshop will address the ways in which intersecting systems of oppression inhibit self-love, and consider self-love as an act of resistance and expression of resilience against those systems.</p>

			<p>We will suggest various ways of cultivating self-love, including affirmations, self-touch, journalling, and different approaches to self-care. Participants will be able to try out some tools, learn about others, and share with fellow femmes and allies their own strategies for the radical practice of self-love.</p>

      		<h4>Sex-Positivity in Practice</h4>

			<p>with <a href="http://www.englishyogaberlin.com/about-english-yoga-berlin/bios/" target="_blank">Meg Saxby</a></p>

			<p>What is sex-positivity, in theory and in practice?</p>

			<p>Using the herstory of sex-positive sex shops as a starting point, sex educators Meg and Kitty from Other Nature, Berlin's alternativer Sexladen, will suggest some of the core values of sex-positivity, and discuss how those values are put into practice.</p>

			<p>We'll unpack some of the messages, norms and values about sex and sexuality that we are commonly exposed to, and explore the idea of sex-positivity as a radical alternative to narratives of shame and harm.</p>

			<p>Participants will be invited to reflect on the relevance and application of sex-positivity to various spheres, including the contexts in which they live, work and do activism, and will work together to establish tools and strategies for creating sex-positive spaces and practices.</p>

				<h4>Communicating Desire</h4>

				<h4>Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Safer Sex</h4>
				<h4>(But Were Too Afraid To Ask)</h4>

				<p>It’s hard to avoid the message that sex should be “safer”, but clear, detailed information about why and how can be less accessible. Moreover, many people feel confident in their knowledge, but find the practice of safer sex more complicated than the theory.</p>
				<p>This fun, informative workshop will outline common sexually transmitted infections, including transmission, symptoms, testing, and treatment. We’ll take a look at some safer sex tools, getting to grips with gloves, down with dams, and building condom competence, and learn about different kinds of risk. Next, we’ll turn to the realities of safer sex choices. How do we communicate with new or existing lovers about protection? We’ll build strategies for negotiation, and face up to the spectre of… killing the mood!</p>

				<p>Whether you’re playing with penises or vulvas, hands or mouths, vibrators or butt plugs, many lovers or one, this workshop will give you the knowledge and confidence to make informed choices, put them into action, and feel sexy doing so. People of all genders and orientations welcome.</p>
