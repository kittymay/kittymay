       		<h4>Exploring Your Sexual Self: Past, Present & Future</h4>
 			<p>with Meg Saxby</p>

			
			<p>"a very freeing experience" - participant feedback, 2014</p>
			
 			<p>The erotic life, encompassing desire, pleasure, fantasy and experience, is a creative and meaningful current in many people's lives: a source of depth, connection and vitality. Yet we can also feel disconnected from, puzzled by, or ashamed of our sexual selves and don't often have the opportunity to consider, express and shape our own erotic journeys.</p>
 
 			<p>This engaging weekend workshop will give participants tools and space to explore their sexual selves, and define their own vision of erotic empowerment. The weekend will be divided into 3 sessions, during which we will connect with our sexual selves as they are today; remember who they were in the past; imagine our brightest erotic futures - and consider the most luscious, fun and self-loving ways of getting there!</p>

 			<div class="note">
 				<p>Please note:</p>
 
				<p>This workshop is open to women, gender queer, intersex and trans folks.</p>

  		<h4>(Re)Claiming Sexuality</h4>
  		<ul><li>a group process over 6 sessions</li></ul>
		
		<p>There are many ways in which we can feel that our sexuality is not entirely our own. We might feel unsure of what we really desire, stuck repeating a pattern, constrained by gender expectations, disconnected from our bodies, or inhibited by inherited values.</p>

		<p>(Re)Claiming Sexuality is an opportunity to find and nurture a sense of sexual agency. Each week will focus on a different area of experience: self-image; pleasure; fantasy; values; relationships; & desire. Exploring these themes, you will have the chance to get to know your sexuality more fully, recognise the things the influence you, and embrace your authentic sexual self.</p>

		<p>Each session will include short exercises designed to spark personal reflection, followed by longer periods of facilitated discussion. There is no obligation to disclose more than is comfortable, and in addition to group exchange, there will be time for solo reflection. Some exercises may work with the body but will not be sexual in nature.</p>

		<p>Group size: maximum 10 participants.</p>
		<p>All genders welcome.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>When: Starting November 2015 - dates tba.  <a href="http://kittymay.com/#/contact" target="_blank">Sign up to my newsletter</a> to stay informed! </li>

			<li>Cost: The fee is for participation in the group, which consists of 6 weekly sessions, with tea and snacks provided. There are four prices available, based on ability to pay:</li>

				<li>240€ if your monthly income is 1000-1500€</li>
				<li>300€ if your monthly income is higher than 1500€ (or a higher fee that you feel reflects your ability to pay)</li>
	        	<li>Initially there are 3 spaces available at the 120€ price. If several people pay the higher fees, more spots at the 120€ price will be opened up. Therefore, please note that if you are able to pay more, doing so could help someone on a lower income to participate.</li>

		</ul>							

		<p>A note on group process: discussion of all areas of experience, including trauma, is possible; however, please be aware that this group is not a substitute for therapy. The intention is to create a supportive environment in which participants can share and exchange without fear of judgement. Building trust and accountability will be an important, ongoing group process in which all participants are invited to participate fully. </p>
