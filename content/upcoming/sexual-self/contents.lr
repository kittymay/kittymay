notes:

This workshop is not intended as a substitute for therapeutic intervention. We ask participants to please make a considered decision about their readiness to participate and to place their well-being at the centre of that choice.

We believe in the capacity of intentional community to create safety, healing, learning and fun. We are committed to creating a space that is as safe and supportive as possible, and invite all participants to share responsibility for this environment.

description:

The erotic life, encompassing desire, pleasure, fantasy and experience, is a creative and meaningful current in many people's lives - a source of depth, connection and vitality. Yet we can also feel disconnected from, puzzled by, or ashamed of our sexual selves and don't often have the opportunity to consider, express and shape our own erotic journeys.

This engaging weekend workshop will give participants tools and space to explore their sexual selves, and define their own vision of erotic empowerment. The weekend will be divided into 3 sessions, during which we will connect with our sexual selves as they are today; remember who they were in the past; imagine our brightest erotic futures - and consider the most luscious, fun and self-loving ways of getting there!
