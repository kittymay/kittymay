        <p>"Compassion is the master emotion of positive change" - Jack Morin</p>
<p>In this class, I'll draw on my experience both as a therapist and a meditation practitioner as we explore what self-compassion is, why it benefits both ourselves and others, and how to cultivate it.</p>
<p>We'll look at the ways in which practicing meditation can help to build self-compassion and how, in turn, self-compassion supports a meditation practice.</p>
<p>
I'll introduce some tools for practice, and there will be space for participants who feel comfortable to exhange experiences and share their self-compassion strategies.</p>
        <p>No meditation experience necessary!</p>

        <p>"There's no wrong way to have a body" - Glenn Marla</p>
<p>How do you feel when you look in the mirror, see a photograph of yourself, or look down at your naked body in the shower? </p>
<p>In this workshop, I’ll draw on my experience both as a therapist and a meditation practitioner as we explore how our thoughts and feelings about our bodies and appearance can impact – and reflect – our overall wellbeing. </p>
        <p>We’ll look at how meditation practices can help us to cultivate a loving, appreciative attitude towards our bodies, as well as learning about and trying out some different tools for infusing our body-image with self-compassion. </p>
        <p>
There will be space for participants who feel comfortable doing so to share experiences and exchange ideas for developing self-compassion and a positive body-image.</p>
        <p>No previous meditation experience required!</p>
        <p>This workshop will build on some concepts and strategies introduced in Self-Compassion: What, Why & How, which takes place again on August 9th (link below), but you are warmly invited to join regardless of whether or not you participated in the earlier workshop.</p>
