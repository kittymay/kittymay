      <h3>Pleasure and the Present Moment</h3>
      <p></p>
      
      <p></p>
      <div class="event-section">
        <p>In this session, we will focus on pleasure and its role in our physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing.</p>
<p>Through meditation, reflective exercises and group discussion, we'll attend to the interplay between sensations of pleasure and the experience of being present. We will also discuss craving and attachment in relation to pleasure.</p>
<p>We'll explore different sources of pleasure, including the erotic. How might a meditation practice enhance sexual pleasure – and can sexual pleasure support our meditation practice?</p>
        <p>No meditation experience necessary.</p>
        <p>Kitty joins the Mindfulness Philosophy and Shinay Meditation class as a guest facilitator for the 4th time. These sessions allow her to blend her skills as a professional sex educator and her experience practicing mindfulness-based meditation to create innovate, fun and thought-provoking workshops. This meditation class takes place every Wednesday, run by <a href=“http://www.elizabishop.com”>Eliza Bishop.</a></p>

      <h3>(Re)Claiming Sexuality</h3>
      <p>A group process over 6 sessions</p>
      
      <p></p>
      <div class="event-section">
        <p>Everyone has the right to feel connected to and good about their sexual selves. Yet there are many ways in which we can feel that our sexuality is not entirely our own. We might feel unsure of what we really desire, stuck repeating a pattern, or constrained by gender expectations; perhaps we're healing from trauma, disconnected from our bodies, or inhibited by inherited values.</p>
<p>This affirming workshop series is an opportunity to get to know, nurture and (re)claim your sexuality. Learn how to tune in to and trust yourself, recognise the things that influence you, improve sexual communication, and develop an authentic sense of sexual agency. You will have the opportunity to connect and explore ideas with others in a supportive environment.</p>
<p>Taking time and space to learn about and attend to your sexuality is a valuable investment in your wellbeing, growth and relationships – and a step towards building a more sex-positive world for all of us!</p>
        <p>Workshop format:</p>
        <p>Each week we'll focus on a different area of experience – such as pleasure, fantasy and relationships – building a holistic view of sexuality over the course of six sessions.</p>
        <p>Sessions include short exercises designed to spark personal reflection, followed by longer periods of facilitated discussion. Some exercises work with the body – such as simple stretches and relaxation – but are not sexual in nature.</p>
        <p>In addition to group exchange, there will be time for solo reflection, and there is no obligation to share more than is comfortable.</p>
        <p>Participants said:</p>
        <p>"Kitty provides a unique approach to discussing sexuality. In contrast to the often superficial and unrealistic handling of sexuality in most public discourse, this course creates a conversation about sex that probably many of us wished we could have had much earlier." </p>
        <p>
“Kitty's guiding presence created a safe space. I enjoyed the different themes every week that tied in together nicely and seemed to come full circle by workshop's end.”</p>
        <p>"Life-changing."</p>

        <p>Please note:</p>
        <p>Discussion of all areas of experience, including trauma, is possible; however, please be aware that this group is not a substitute for therapy. The intention is to create a supportive environment in which participants can share and exchange without fear of judgement. Building trust and accountability will be an important, ongoing group process in which all participants are invited to participate fully.</p>
