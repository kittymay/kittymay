        <p>When I tell people that I'm a sex educator, they often assume that I work with kids. What exactly is sex ed for grown-ups?</p>
<p>On June 24th I'll be speaking at Dinner and A Movie, Ausland's regular, interdisciplinary evening of "pleasure, curiosity, enlightenment, frivolity, engagement and more".</p>
<p>Educating ourselves about sexuality as adults involves a huge amount of unlearning. I'll elucidate on this, as well as answering some of the common questions about sex ed for grown-ups!

      <h3>(Re)Claiming Sexuality</h3>
      <p>A group process over 6 sessions. January 4th - February 8th 2017</p>
      
      <p></p>
      <div class="event-section">
        <p>Everyone has the right to feel connected to and good about their sexual selves. Yet there are many ways in which we can feel that our sexuality is not entirely our own. We might feel unsure of what we really desire, stuck repeating a pattern, or constrained by gender expectations; perhaps we're healing from trauma, disconnected from our bodies, or inhibited by inherited values.</p>
<p>This affirming workshop series is an opportunity to get to know, nurture and (re)claim your sexuality. Learn how to tune in to and trust yourself, recognise the things that influence you, improve sexual communication, and develop an authentic sense of sexual agency. You will have the opportunity to connect and explore ideas with others in a supportive environment.</p>
<p>Taking time and space to learn about and attend to your sexuality is a valuable investment in your wellbeing, growth and relationships – and a step towards building a more sex-positive world for all of us!</p>
        <p>Workshop format:</p>
        <p>Each week we'll focus on a different area of experience – such as pleasure, fantasy and relationships – building a holistic view of sexuality over the course of six sessions.</p>
        <p>Sessions include short exercises designed to spark personal reflection, followed by longer periods of facilitated discussion. Some exercises work with the body – such as simple stretches and relaxation – but are not sexual in nature.</p>
        <p>In addition to group exchange, there will be time for solo reflection, and there is no obligation to share more than is comfortable.</p>
        <p>Participants said:</p>
        <p>"Kitty provides a unique approach to discussing sexuality. In contrast to the often superficial and unrealistic handling of sexuality in most public discourse, this course creates a conversation about sex that probably many of us wished we could have had much earlier." </p>
        <p>
“Kitty's guiding presence created a safe space. I enjoyed the different themes every week that tied in together nicely and seemed to come full circle by workshop's end.”</p>
        <p>"Life-changing."</p>
