      <h3>Pleasure and the Present Moment</h3>
      <p></p>
      
      <p></p>
      <div class="event-section">
        <p>In this session, we will focus on pleasure and its role in our physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing.</p>
<p>Through meditation, reflective exercises and group discussion, we'll attend to the interplay between sensations of pleasure and the experience of being present. We will also discuss craving and attachment in relation to pleasure.</p>
<p>We'll explore different sources of pleasure, including the erotic. How might a meditation practice enhance sexual pleasure – and can sexual pleasure support our meditation practice?</p>
        <p>No meditation experience necessary.</p>
        <p>Kitty joins the Mindfulness Philosophy and Shinay Meditation class as a guest facilitator for the 4th time. These sessions allow her to blend her skills as a professional sex educator and her experience practicing mindfulness-based meditation to create innovate, fun and thought-provoking workshops. This meditation class takes place every Wednesday, run by <a href=“http://www.elizabishop.com”>Eliza Bishop.</a></p>

      <h3>(Re)Claiming Sexuality</h3>
      <p>A group process over 6 sessions</p>
      
      <p></p>
      <div class="event-section">
        <p>There are many ways in which we can feel that our sexuality is not entirely our own. We might feel unsure of what we really desire, stuck repeating a pattern, constrained by gender expectations, disconnected from our bodies, or inhibited by inherited values.</p>
<p>(Re)Claiming Sexuality is an opportunity to find and nurture a sense of sexual agency. Each week will focus on a different area of experience - self-image; pleasure; fantasy; values; relationships; &amp; desire. Exploring these themes, you will have the chance to get to know your sexuality more fully, recognise the things the influence you, and embrace your authentic sexual self.</p>
<p>Each session will include short exercises designed to spark personal reflection, followed by longer periods of facilitated discussion. There is no obligation to disclose more than is comfortable, and in addition to group exchange, there will be time for solo reflection. Some exercises may work with the body but will not be sexual in nature.</p>
<p>Group size - maximum 10 participants.</p>

      </div>

      
      <div class="event-section note">
        <p>Please note:</p>
        <p>Discussion of all areas of experience, including trauma, is possible; however, please be aware that this group is not a substitute for therapy. The intention is to create a supportive environment in which participants can share and exchange without fear of judgement. Building trust and accountability will be an important, ongoing group process in which all participants are invited to participate fully.</p>
